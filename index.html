    Domestic cats may be called 'house cats' when kept as indoor pets. They are one of the most popular pets in the world. <strong > Humans keep them for hunting mice and rats, and as friends.</strong> There are also farm cats, which keep mice and rats away; and feral cats, which are domestic cats that live away from humans. <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat"> In 2021, there were about 220 million pet cats and 480 million feral cats in the world.</a></p>
